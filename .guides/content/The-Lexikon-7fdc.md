J

In the top bar in this page you will see a '?' icon. Press it and then enter 'concat' in the search field. You can then select `array.concat` to get help and see examples.

Where you see 'var', simply ignore it for the time being. So if you see something like ...

```javascript
var alphaNumeric = alpha.concat(numeric);
```

... you can ignore the `var` and the `;` at the end.
