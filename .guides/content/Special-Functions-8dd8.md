When using Flode you have access to a very wide range of functions to help you do clever things with your data.

- **Math functions** give you access to things like sin, cos, PI and much more
- **String functions** let you search and convert strings
- **Array functions** let you search, slice up and otherwise manipulate arrays

In fact as Flode uses Javascript as its engine, anything you can do in Javascript can be done in Flode.

This Unit explores some of the more commonly used functions and gives you some challenges to work on.
