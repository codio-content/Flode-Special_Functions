Here are some commonly used Array functions. 

You can see a couple of these in action in the Flode chart on the left. They all work in the same way, so feel free to experiment.

## Commonly used functions
The list below shows just a few of the available functions. To see them all, [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). 

### Modifiers
These functions modify the array directly.

**Array.pop()** - removes the last element from an array and returns that element, should you need it.
**Array.push()** - adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Array.shift()** - removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
**Array.unshift()** - adds one or more elements to the front of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Array.reverse()** - reverses the order of the elements of an array in place â€” the first becomes the last, and the last becomes the first.
**Array.sort()** - sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.

### Accessors
These methods do not modify the array and return some representation of the array.

**Array.concat()** - returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other array(s) and/or value(s).
**Array.includes()** determines whether an array contains a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.
**Array.join()** - joins all elements of an array into a string.
**Array.slice()** - extracts a section of an array and returns a new array.
**Array.toString()** - returns a string representing the array and its elements.
**Array.indexOf()** - returns the first (least) index of an element within the array equal to the specified value, or -1 if none is found.
**Array.lastIndexOf()** - returns the last (greatest) index of an element within the array equal to the specified value, or -1 if none is found.
