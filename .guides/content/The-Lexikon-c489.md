Codio comes with a built in Lexikon that lets you get help on functions. 

Flode uses the same functions as Javascript so you can use the Javascript Lexikon to get help on any of the functions mentioned on the previous page.

In the top bar in this page you will see a '?' icon. Press it and then enter 'pi' in the search field. You can then select `Math.PI` to get help and see examples.

If you see 'var', simply ignore it for the time being. So if you see something like ...

```javascript
var alphaNumeric = alpha.concat(numeric);
```

... you can ignore the `var` and the `;` at the end.
