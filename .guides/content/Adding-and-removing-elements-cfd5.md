On the last page you saw some functions that add and remove elements from the start or end of an array.

Take a look at the Flode chart on the left hand side. You should be able to figure out what is going on by stepping though it.

We'll then do a couple of challenges to see:

**Array.pop()** - removes the last element from an array and returns that element, should you need it.
**Array.push()** - adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Array.shift()** - removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
**Array.unshift()** - adds one or more elements to the front of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Array.reverse()** - reverses the order of the elements of an array in place â€” the first becomes the last, and the last becomes the first.
**Array.sort()** - sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
